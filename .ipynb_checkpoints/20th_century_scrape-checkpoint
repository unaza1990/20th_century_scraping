The 20th century changed the world in unprecedented ways. The World Wars sparked tension between countries and led to the creation of atomic bombs, the Cold War led to the Space Race and the creation of space-based rockets, and the World Wide Web was created. These advancements have played a significant role in citizens' lives and shaped the 21st century into what it is today.
The new beginning of the 20th century marked significant changes. The 1900s saw the decade herald a series of inventions, including the automobile, airplane and radio broadcasting. 1914 saw the completion of the Panama Canal.
The Scramble for Africa continued in the 1900s and resulted in wars and genocide across the continent. The atrocities in the Congo Free State shocked the civilized world.
